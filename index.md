### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was a good introductory lab to get accustomed to programming. We had to learn how to correctly declare variables, take user input, and then display it. This lab was a good way to transition into the later labs we would face in the year.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was also fun because it challenged us to use break statements with our for loop. We hadn't done that before so it was a task for my partner and I to properly implement it within our code. We found it interesting to try and use what we had learned in the lecture and implement it within our program.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was interesting because of the way we needed to use constructors. It was tricky to write the "Random Number Generator" function, so it made the lab a little difficult. However, we noticed how we could also write the constructor statements that we wrote and replace them with "if" statements.
